# Pollution_classification_using_ML

In this project by using Machine Learning classification algorithms Air Pollution of a particular area is classified into 4 categories i.e., Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous. These are categorized based on  Temperature, Humidity, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, Distance from the industrial area and Population Density.

**Dataset overview**

This dataset focuses on air quality assessment across various regions. The dataset contains 5000 samples and captures critical environmental and demographic factors that influence pollution levels.

Key Features:

* Temperature (°C): Average temperature of the region.
* Humidity (%): Relative humidity recorded in the region.
* PM2.5 Concentration (µg/m³): Fine particulate matter levels.
* PM10 Concentration (µg/m³): Coarse particulate matter levels.
* NO2 Concentration (ppb): Nitrogen dioxide levels.
* SO2 Concentration (ppb): Sulfur dioxide levels.
* CO Concentration (ppm): Carbon monoxide levels.
* Proximity to Industrial Areas (km): Distance to the nearest industrial zone.
* Population Density (people/km²): Number of people per square kilometer in the region.

 Target Variable:

* Air Quality Levels:
 1. Good: Clean air with low pollution levels.
 2. Moderate: Acceptable air quality but with some pollutants present.
 3. Poor: Noticeable pollution that may cause health issues for sensitive groups.
 4. Hazardous: Highly polluted air posing serious health risks to the population.
